## EcoSense Datasets - Contributing Knowledge to Economy Discipline

Our datasets are divided into 3 categories.
- Economy topics
- Data Sources from AWS Data Exchange providers
- Research insights from community contributors and researchers

### Topics/Theory/Concepts based Datasets (to be updated...)

Note: We plan to cover 500+ economy subject topics, 2000+ customized datasets mapped to topics so that you can put your theoretical knowledge to practical use.
